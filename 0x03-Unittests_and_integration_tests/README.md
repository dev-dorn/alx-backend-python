# 0x03. Unittests and Integration Tests

This project contains unit tests and integration tests written in Python 3.7.  
The goal is to practice test-driven development (TDD), parameterized testing, mocking, and integration testing techniques.  

All code and tests follow the ALX requirements:
- All files are interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3.7**.
- All Python files start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- All files end with a new line.
- All files are **pycodestyle (version 2.5)** compliant.
- All files are executable.
- Each module, class, and function contains a **full documentation string** (docstring).
- All functions and coroutines use **type annotations**.
